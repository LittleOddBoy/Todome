# Todome ~ a useful todo list, using pure JavaScript!

Todome (please read "todo-me") is a normal todo list designed with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com) and developed with pure JavaScript (or in our world, developed with ECMAScript), also all of the data stored by [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API/Using_IndexedDB).
it's not just a simple project to practice JavaScript and IDB (means IndexedDB), in each line I tried to make a art. I put myself in this situation to create the most realistic todo list project that I can.
